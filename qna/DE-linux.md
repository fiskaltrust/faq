## Answer
Starting with version 1.3.3, it is possible to run fiskaltrust.Middleware on Linux and macOS, using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/). Just configure a Cashbox and download the Mono launcher via the respective button in the Cashbox overview. As on Windows, the downloaded zip file contains scripts to install and test the Middleware.
