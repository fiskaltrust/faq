## Answer

Please find the list of supported operating systems for Germany in the [product description of fiskaltrust.Middleware](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/product-description/germany/products-and-services/caas/products/middleware) (in German).

If your platform is currently not supported natively by fiskaltrust.Middleware, solutions can be still found considering different architectural scenarios described in the [product documentation](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/rollout-doc/middleware#rollout-scenarios).
