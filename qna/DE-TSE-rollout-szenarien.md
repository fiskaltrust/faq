## Answer

It is possible to operate more than one cash register with a TSE. There are some prerequisites and it also depends on the used POS system, therefore there is no general answer to that question.

We recommend to have a look on our [guideline for rollout scenarios](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/rollout-doc/middleware#rollout-scenarios) to assess several options and to find a solution which fits your requirements.
