## Answer

With the registration of your company in the fiskaltrust.portal on the one hand an account and on the other hand a contact is created. This contact has as primary contact every possible authorization in the account of the company.
If you create additional contacts under <kbd>Company name</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Employee</kbd>, you can click on the record and assign specific permissions. The highlighted record is the one with the primary role.
Below the permissions you will further find the <kbd>Primary Contact</kbd> button, which you can use to set a contact as the new primary contact.
By changing the primary contact, all permissions of the previous primary account are revoked and its account owner **will not be able to log on to the fiskaltrust.Portal** any longer, as that action requires the read permission as minimum. The new primary contact may assign permissions to this contact again, if desired.
