## Answer

With the registration of your company in the fiskaltrust.portal on the one hand an account and on the other hand a contact is created. This contact has as primary contact every possible authorization in the account of the company.
If you create additional contacts under <kbd>Company name</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Employee</kbd>, you can click on the record and assign specific permissions. The highlighted record is the one with the primary role.
Below the permissions you will further find the <kbd>Primary Contact</kbd> button, which you can use to set a contact as the new primary contact.
By changing the primary contact, all permissions are released for the selected contact and your permissions are completely disabled. This means that with your contact **no login in the portal** is possible anymore. The new primary contact can assign permissions to your contact again, if desired.
