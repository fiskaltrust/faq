Des Weiteren erklärt sich der Betreiber damit einverstanden, dass seine Daten, egal welcher Art, an Dritte bzw.

### Explanation "for analysis purposes":
fiskaltrust gmbh performs a wide variety of analyses, which cannot be listed completely due to their diversity. Here is an exemplary list: 

* fiskaltrust gmbh, for example, performs analyses to determine the required storage capacity. On the one hand, this is necessary to ensure sufficient storage capacity for all incoming document data and, on the other hand, it is important for determining the internal cost structure.  
* Another example would be to perform an analysis of the products in circulation, whether cloud-based or hardware-based or which manufacturer. The results from this analysis are used to ensure the availability of the required products at our distributor.
* Last example is analysis of incoming support requests. If, for example, support requests of the same type are received frequently, then fiskaltust will work out improvement concepts, the existing documentation may need to be formulated more precisely, new applications may need to be made available in the portal, or the rollout process may need to be simplified, etc.

You can see the diversity of the different analyses from this exemplary list.

### Explanation "beyond the term of the contract". 
If the contract with fiskaltrust gmbh is terminated or the contractual basis ceases to exist, fiskaltrust gmbh may be obliged, depending on the respective product, to store the data beyond the contract period due to legal requirements. The data storage is an obligation resulting from the respective product in connection with the legal obligations.

### Who are "third parties or partners" of fiskaltrust gmbh?
In order to offer the cash register operator a complete package, fiskaltrust gmbh works together with third parties and partners: 

- For example, fiskaltrust gmbh does not manufacture the TSE (Technical Security Equipment) itself, but purchases it from various providers. These deliver cloud- and hardware-based TSE. This enables fiskaltrust gmbh to offer solutions for a wide variety of cash register systems and to enable cash register operators to implement them in compliance with the law.
- Furthermore, fiskaltrust gmbh uses a distributor to deliver the ordered hardware reliably and promptly to the cash register operator.

A list of the existing subcontractors of fiskaltrust gmbh can be requested at any time. You can find it in the portal under **<kbd>Tools</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Download</kbd>**.
 >If fiskaltrust gmbh intends to use a new subcontractor as a partner, all customers will be informed about this on the one hand via our portal and on the other hand by mail to the contact address given by the cash register operator. 
 If the customer does not agree with the cooperation between fiskaltrust gmbh and the new subcontractor, he can object to the intended cooperation. In this case, an attempt will be made to find a solution together that is satisfactory for all parties involved.
