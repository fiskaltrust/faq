## Answer
The service for the cloud-solution is not free of charge, but you can try the service in the sandbox without incurring any cost.

To create a cloud CashBox, certain conditions must be met beforehand:

* A valid SIREN number must be entered and checked in the basic data of the company.
* A valid branch must be registered. For this, the address of the branch and its SIRET number must be entered and verified.

Once these two conditions are met, a cloud CashBox can be created in following steps:

**Step One:**<br />Get in cintact with the French sales team to receive a quote for a ChaîneCloud. The quote will be free of charge, but is necessary for producing the product.

**Step Two:**<br />Open the Shop menu on the left hand sidebar on the fiskaltrust.Portal. Then click on “Quotes” and put the quote in the shopping cart. Select the outlet in the field “Location Id” (located at the top of the page) for which you use ChaîneCloud. This is important because the outlet can not be changed afterwards!

**Step Three:**<br />Click on the green button “Binding order”. After the order was successfully placed, you will receive an email with the order confirmation and the invoice for the purchased product(s).

You can see the state of your order(s) under the Shop menu subsection “Orders” and/or “Invoice”.

**Step four:**<br />The CashBox will be created automatically within several minutes after the order is confirmed. You will find it in the Configuration menu, subcategory “CashBox”. The name starts with “fiskaltrust.ChaîneCloud” and has an upcounting number on the end.

**Step Five:**<br />Click on the rebuild configuration button (refresh circle arrows) in the row of the relevant CashBox.

**Hint:**<br />For easier identification, you can change the description of the CashBox and/or Queue in the Configuration menu.
