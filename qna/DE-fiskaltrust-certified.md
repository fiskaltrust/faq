## Answer

Fiskaltrust is **NOT** a technical security unit (TSE). Fiskaltrust offers a free of charge fiscalization middleware that is able to communicate with any officially certified TSE. Therefore fiskaltrust is not certified according to BSI TR-03153, but the supported TSEs such as Swissbit, Cryptovision, Diebold, Epson TSE are officially certified by the german Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
